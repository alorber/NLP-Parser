# Parser

The goal of this project was to implement a parser. 

The program prompts the user for a text file containing a context free grammar (CFG) in Chomsky normal form (CNF) and after reading the grammar, it allows the user to enter sentences, one at a time. For each sentence, the program parses the sentence using the Cocke-Kasami-Younger (CKY) algorithm. 

The program then outputs each valid parse in bracketed notation, as well as asks the user if they wish to see the textual parse tree. Finally, the program prints the number of valid parses.
